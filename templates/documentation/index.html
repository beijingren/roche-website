The <em>Siku quanshu</em> 四庫全書 (Complete library of the four branches)
was one of the last major imperial editorial project of the
late imperial China.
The sixth ruler of the Qing 清 dynasty, the long reigning
Qianlong 乾隆 emperor (r. 1735-1796) issued an edict,
on the very first
day of the new chinese year 1772, calling on his officials to collect books from
all over the empire to expand the imperial book collection.
In the course of the edition process under the
chief editors Ji Yun 紀昀 (zi Xiaolan 曉嵐, 1724--1805) and Lu Xixiong 陸錫熊       
(zi Jiannan 健男, 1734--1792) 3471 works (in 79070 <em>juan</em>)
of the 13501 works sent in where selected for inclusion.
For additional 6793 titles extensive bibliographic and scholarly
notes where written and published under the title <em>Siku quanshu zongmu tiyao</em>
四庫全書提要 (Catalogue (with critical abstracts) of the Complete library of the
four branches).

<h4>How To Markup Texts Manually?</h4>

<p>
After you have set up your Github account and fetched the file from the repository you will notice that all texts are stored in XML files. The content of the files is follows the standards of the Text Encoding Initiative. A short introduction to the topic can be found here:  <a href="http://www.teibyexample.org/">http://www.teibyexample.org/</a>.  If you intend to contribute your own text the best method is to open one of the texts from our repositry and fill the standardized structure of the TEI document with the content.
</p>

<p>
To provide the reader on the website with visual aids for a quicker understanding of the texts the following semantic markups are currently supported: place names, personal names, dates, and terms. The respective tags are &lt;persName&gt;, &lt;placeName&gt;, &lt;date&gt;, and &lt;term&gt;. Characters marked up with these texts appear later coloured on the website and can be clicked on the get further information.
</p>

<h4>How To Markup Texts Automatically?</h4>
<p>
Use the UIMA analysis pipeline. Either the online version on this website or the standalone version in the bertie-uima repo. For TEI documents the engines run in the following order:
</p>

<ol>
<li>PreprocessAnalysisEngine</li>
<li>AuxiliaryAnalysisEngine</li>
<li>NumberUnitAnalysisEngine</li>
<li>PersNameAnalysisEngine</li>
<li>DateTimeAnalysisEngine</li>
<li>PlaceNameAnalysisEngine</li>
<li>DeduplicatorAnalysisEngine</li>
